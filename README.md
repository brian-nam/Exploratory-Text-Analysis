<p align="center"><strong>DS5001 Final Project in University of Virginia's Masters in Data Science program</strong>


<h2>About</h2>
The notebook will take the raw text files of the novels from Project Gutenberg and generate a preliminary table has the paragraphs from each novel in separate rows, indexed by book id, chapter number, and paragraph number (DOC). It was also create a table which contains information about the novels (LIB). It then annotates the tables into two more tables, TOKEN and VOCAB, which contains information about the terms used in all of the novels. After cleaning the data to remove punctuations, numbers, and insignificant terms (using TFIDF values) it further annotates the tables using PCA, topic models, and word2vec to infer information about the authors and the novels themselves.<br />
<br />
Output files contain the set of tables that conform to the standard tet analytics data model and to the machine learning corpus format.
